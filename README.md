##Des Moines, Iowa Analysis

The Population of Des Moines, Iowa in 2019 is 215,932  (https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?q=Des%20Moines%20city,%20Iowa&g=1600000US1921000) 

Des Moines is the State Capital of Iowa with a variety of great tourist attractions  (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/), it attracts 13.7 million tourists each year.

Proportionate with ridership in NY, we would expect to see about 3.3% of tourists and residents in Des Moines utilize a bike sharing service.  This would equate to a potential of 459,225 rides in the month of August.

To be able to support all the potential rides would require 2,750 bikes positioned around the city.  However, targeting particularly high traffic destinations would allow for a start with fewer bikes and growth could expand as the demand develops over time.
